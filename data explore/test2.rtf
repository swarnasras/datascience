\f0\b\fs50 \cf2 \cb3 Question 1\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 Under the lattice graphics system, what do the primary plotting functions like xyplot() and bwplot() return?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 an object of class "plot"\
an object of class "trellis" correct\
an object of class "lattice"\
nothing; only a plot is made\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 2\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 What is produced by the following code?
\f1\fs26 \cb4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 library(nlme)\
library(lattice)\
xyplot(weight ~ Time | Diet, BodyWeight)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 A set of 11 panels showing the relationship between weight and diet for each time.\
A set of 3 panels showing the relationship between weight and time for each rat.\
A set of 16 panels showing the relationship between weight and time for each rat.\
A set of 3 panels showing the relationship between weight and time for each diet. (Correct)\

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 3\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 Annotation of plots in any plotting system involves adding points, lines, or text to the plot, in addition to customizing axis labels or adding titles. Different plotting systems have different sets of functions for annotating plots in this way. Which of the following functions can be used to annotate the panels in a multi-panel lattice plot?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 points()\
axis()\
panel.abline() (correct)\
text()\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 4\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 The following code does NOT result in a plot appearing on the screen device.
\f1\fs26 \cb4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 library(lattice)\
library(datasets)\
data(airquality)\
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | factor(Month), data = airquality)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 Which of the following is an explanation for why no plot appears?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 The xyplot() function, by default, sends plots to the PDF device.\
The object 'p' has not yet been printed with the appropriate print method. (correct)\
There is a syntax error in the call to xyplot().\
The variables being plotted are not found in that dataset.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 5\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 In the lattice system, which of the following functions can be used to finely control the appearance of all lattice plots?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 trellis.par.set() (correct)\
par()\
print.trellis()\
splom()\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 6\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 What is ggplot2 an implementation of?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 the Grammar of Graphics developed by Leland Wilkinson (correct)\
the base plotting system in R\
the S language originally developed by Bell Labs\
a 3D visualization system\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 7\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 Load the `airquality' dataset form the datasets package in R.
\f1\fs26 \cb4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 library(datasets)\
data(airquality)	\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 I am interested in examining how the relationship between ozone and wind speed varies across each month. What would be the appropriate code to visualize that using ggplot2?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420

\f1\fs26 \cf2 \cb4 qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality)\
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ factor(Month))\
airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))\
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month) (correct)\
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, geom = "smooth")\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\f0\b\fs50 \cf2 \cb3 Question 8\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 What is a 
\b geom
\b0  in the ggplot2 system?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 a statistical transformation\
a method for making conditioning plots\
a method for mapping data to attributes like color and size\
a plotting object like point, line, or other shape (correct)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 9\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 When I run the following code I get an error:
\f1\fs26 \cb4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 library(ggplot2)\
g <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))\
print(g)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 I was expecting a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' to appear. What's the problem?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 There is a syntax error in the call to ggplot.\
The object 'g' does not have a print method.\
The dataset is too large and hence cannot be plotted to the screen.\
ggplot does not yet know what type of layer to add to the plot. (correct)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl840\sa210

\b\fs50 \cf2 Question 10\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\b0\fs28 \cf2 The following code creates a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' from the movies dataset in the ggplot2 package. After loading the ggplot2 package with the library() function, I can run
\f1\fs26 \cb4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420
\cf2 qplot(votes, rating, data = movies)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl560

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 How can I modify the the code above to add a smoother to the scatterplot?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420

\f1\fs24 \cf5 \cb6 qplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + geom_smooth() (correct)
\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 \

\f1\fs24 \cf5 \cb6 qplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + stats_smooth("loess")
\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 \

\f1\fs24 \cf5 \cb6 qplot(votes, rating, data = movies, panel = panel.loess)
\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 \

\f1\fs24 \cf5 \cb6 qplot(votes, rating, data = movies, smooth = "loess")
\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 \
